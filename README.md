# Inverse-Kinematics-Arm

This is the base of what I use to control my robots, initially I was doing everything with Python and Webots, but I wasn't quite happy with the limitations so I decided to build all my simulations in Unity (which I'm very familar with). In it I can build any 3D robot of any shape and size, run C# code to control that 3D version and easily send that information to other devices via wifi or bluetooh (like the raspberry pi, which translates the received data to a real robot), with Unity I can also easily run the simulation in any other platform (including my phone) which allows me to control the real robot from anywhere.

original base movement by Unvious22 (the code has been heavily changed to my needs, preferences and expanded to allow multiple limbs and targets).
